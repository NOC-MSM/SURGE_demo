# SURGE_demo
NEMO v5.0.1 Hackathon Storm Surge Demonstrator using Shallow Water Equations

## Plan:

* Create demonstrator for existing Shallow Water Gyre test configuration.
* Introduce atmospheric pressure term to the SWE code.
* Create idealised Tropical Cyclone forcing (analytical winds & atmospheric pressure).
* Tidal boundary conditions / bathymetry.
